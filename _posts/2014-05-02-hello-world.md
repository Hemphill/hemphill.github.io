What's up world! Using this page to test out typographic styling. You need things like 
this when you hand style your blog. Move along -- there really isn't much to see here.

Going to "quote something" to make sure those quotes look nice and curly, 
but don't trip, it doesn't make them 'girly'. 

Just like your momma said "they would"... FINE, she didn't actually say that, but I 
want to "keep it real" by quoting 'things' that shouldn't be quoted. 

"Perhaps have a 'quote inside' another quote."

> This is a mother f\*@king block quote! With lots of clever stuff to say, and 
> that's why we are quoting it! Might even use some hot ellipsis... mind, blown!
